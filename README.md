# chord-tab-mapper
For musicians who write chords/tabs to music, makes it simple to map chords/tabs to music and outputting the result in format that is most familiar to musicians.

## Phase 1
Develop the chord mapper that allows you to add chords to the lyrics of a song and then output to specific formats.

## Phase 2
Starting with a guitar as the mapping instrument, develop the tab mapper that creates a six line diagram that lets you write the finger diagram of chord to a song and output to a specific output
